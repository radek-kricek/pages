      <description>Nice to meet you!
My name is Radek and I live in Germany. My focus is to create insightful projects from structured data.
Large part of my work is related to environmental and scientific topics, because these are my life-long passions. I possess PhD in the didactics of physics and had the pleasure to teach physics and math for several years as well as doing science outreach for the Czech Academy of Sciences.</description>
